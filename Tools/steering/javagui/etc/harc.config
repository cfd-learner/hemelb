# You should specify the Java command to use here.  This must be Java 1.5.x
# or later.  You can specify this either by 
#     1. setting JAVA_HOME, to point to your Java installation, or by
#     2. setting JAVACMD to point to your Java executable, e.g. /usr/bin/java
# If java is not at $JAVA_HOME/bin/java, specify JAVACMD instead.
#
#JAVA_HOME=$JAVA_HOME
JAVACMD=/usr/bin/java

# If Java 1.5.x is not available for your Platform, 1.4.2 may be used, but
# this is not fully supported.  Please see the INSTALL file, and also
# JAVA_1.4.2_DISCLAIMER.  If you really want to use 1.4.2, uncomment the
# line below, setting REALLY_USE_JVM142
#
# REALLY_USE_JVM142=1

# This should point to the top of the CoG JGlobus V1.4 installation
