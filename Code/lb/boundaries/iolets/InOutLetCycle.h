         * Generic base InOutLet with varying update period and communications strategy.
         * This class exists to allow templating the update period as well as the bool which determines
         * whether the density values are to be updated locally or centrally through the BCproc. These
         * depend on the update rule of the InOutLet so it was chosen to be templated and it also allows
         * for some IOlets to be updated at regular intervals from the BCproc whilst allowing others
         * with simpler updating rules to update locally and save on communications.
         *
         * @tparam updatePeriod densityBuffer is recalculated every updatePeriod time steps. If
         *                 it is 0 then the densityBuffer is only initialised at the begining
         *                 and updated only when simulation is reset
         * @tparam comms if true BCproc updates values and sends them out. If false relevant procs update
         *          locally.
